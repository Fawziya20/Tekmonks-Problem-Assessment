# Tekmonks-Problem-Assessment

### Problem Statement:
- Do process HTML using a basic approach to extract the latest stories.
- Do not use internal or external libraries/packages to process the text.
“use any language” application which will return me the latest 6 stories on Time.com's
(highlighted as in image) when I call it as a custom API.
The Source URL is https://time.com

### Problem Approach:

Data Retrieval: You need to retrieve the latest stories from Time.com. For this, you can use Python's built-in libraries like http.client to make an HTTP request and re to parse the HTML content.

Data Processing: Extract the relevant information (titles and URLs) from the HTML content using regular expressions or other parsing techniques.

Data Presentation: Present the extracted data in a structured format, such as JSON or HTML, for the API response.

API Response: Return the processed data as a response to the API request.

Run the Server: Run the local host server to make the API accessible.

Client-Side Integration: You can use a web browser or a Python script to make requests and display the latest stories.
